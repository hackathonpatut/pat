## Pat – reboot your work career

Hack at Junction 2017. Includes huge database, tools to handle profession/skill data, script for parsing PDF's, machine learning algorithm for CV's and some simple views for React web app.

This is done in hackathon when learning new and having horrible hurry all the time, so code is a huge mess. Should not be copied or deployed to real place.
